- Discussion topics:
	- Should we trust this computation?
	- What should we trust more - computation, experiment, or theory?
	- If you believe my first set of code, should you believe the second?
	- If I were to publish this, and you were a reviewer, what would you need to see?
		- theory
		- compute
		- both
	- How should I convey the compute?
	- where is this running?
- bigger discussion
	- science and computational science - small demo of one way to use compute, to explore ideas and develop theory
	- modeling vs data analysis => rest of class...
	- link to stuff fereydoun and megan - what is the point?
	- how do we trust our results?
		- repeatability
		- replication
		- reproducibility
	- how do we break down data analysis workflows?
		- data, cleaning, processing,  analysis, statistics/summarization
		- validation?
	- controls
		- critical thinking about each step of the process
		- positive vs negative controls, etc.
