Thoughts:

* use 'samtools tview' to look at positions where there are lots of
  differences.
  
* outline diagram of variant calling.

* make sure to point out mapping & reference genome flaws:

  * mapping relies on only small changes
  * mapping won't detect new stuff
  * you have to use different approaches to find uncovered stuff;
    no easy way to get a summary.
  * mapping uses heuristics that may be approximate (true in general)
  
  How big a problem are this? (How would we know? :)
  
* other things to point out & discuss:

  * we'll talk about assembly during a different set of 3 labs
  * why do we have so many steps!?
