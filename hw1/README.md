# Lab / Homework 1

Due Thursday, Feb 9th, 5pm.

To turn in, e-mail the document to Titus at ctbrown@ucdavis.edu

## Task: Call variants!

Run through variant calling with the SRR2584857 reads, but this time
use the reference genome that will be at 

    ~/2017-ucdavis-igg201b/hw1/ecoli-rel606-ctb.fa.gz
    
after you do your git clone.

1. Record all the commands you run at the command line in a document.
   (A text file or a Word file is fine.)

2. At the bottom of the document, include the VCF file lines that are
*different* from the ones you generated in [lab 2](../lab2/README.md).
Note that the previous VCF file is available for download in
[lab 3](../lab3/README.md).

   You can ignore the comment lines; just copy/paste in the variant lines.

3. Send the document to Titus!
